# Truth-Table-Generator
This repo contains a few experimental projects of mine. First, `PropLogicSolver` is a .Net Standard 2.1 library for solving logical statements.
It employes some more advanced features of C#, such as `yeild return` genorators, and the expressions API.

`TruthTableSolver` is a ASP.NET Core API with a (poorly made) Elm frontend that consumes the above library.

`TruthTableSolverBlazorWasm` is a... well Blazor WebAssembly frontend that consumes the above library <em>in browser.</em>
This is a far better designed site that is up at https://andyblarblar.github.io/Truth-Table-Generator/
